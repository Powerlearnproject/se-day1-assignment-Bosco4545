#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

The application of fundamental engineering concepts to software development to successfully create, maintain, and manage software while providing usefulness, flexibility, and reliability is known as software engineering. It uses project management strategies, programming techniques, and organized procedures to create high-quality software solutions.
Importance in the Technology Sector: Guarantees software efficiency and dependability; lowers errors and boosts performance.
Long-term software expansion and adaptation are made possible by scalability and maintainability.
Cost-effectiveness: Lowers expenses by reducing mistakes and rework.
Security and compliance: Assures that rules are followed and helps in preventing security breaches.
Encourages innovation: This is crucial for creating new automation, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence technologies.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

The Origin of Software Engineering in 1968
To address the software crisis, the NATO Software Engineering Conference coined the term "software engineering" and placed a strong emphasis on methodical development and organized programming.
Introduction of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in the 1970s and 1980s
Modular, reusable code structures were developed by languages like Smalltalk and C++, which enhanced software architecture and decreased complexity.
The Agile Manifesto, 2001
a set of guidelines encouraging adaptability, teamwork, and iterative development that gave rise to contemporary Agile approaches that are still in use today.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Determining the project's scope and comprehending user needs are two aspects of requirement analysis.
Planning entails developing budgets, schedules, and risk analyses.
Design: Outlining the system's components, data models, and architecture.
Writing actual software by design standards is known as implementation (coding).
Testing: Using different testing levels to find and address bugs.
Software release for users is known as deployment.
Updates and maintenance include adding features, resolving problems, and enhancing functionality.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Feature     	             Waterfall                                 	 Agile
Approach	                 Linear, step-by-step	                       Iterative, flexible
Flexibility	               Changes are difficult	                     Adaptable to changes
Testing	                   Done after development	                     Continuous testing
Project Suitability	       Best for well-defined, stable projects	     Best for dynamic, evolving projects
Examples:
Waterfall – Used in projects like military defense systems, where changes are costly.
Agile – Ideal for startups and mobile app development, where frequent updates are needed.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software developers create software applications by writing, testing, and maintaining code.
A quality assurance (QA) engineer tests software to make sure it is reliable and satisfies specifications.
To guarantee effective completion, the project manager keeps an eye on communication, resources, and schedules.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): Offer resources for effective code writing, debugging, and testing.
Examples include Eclipse, JetBrains IntelliJ, and Visual Studio Code.
Version Control Systems (VCS): Oversee developer participation and changes to the source code.
These are a few examples: Git, GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Code management complexity → Make use of design patterns and modular programming.
Tight deadlines → Use Agile to increase productivity and flexibility.
Solving Testing and Debugging Problems ← Make use of automated testing technologies such as Jest or Selenium.
Keeping Up with New Technologies → Ongoing education through reading, classes, and practical projects.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit testing verifies the accuracy of specific parts (such as functions and classes).
Integration testing ensures that various components are compatible.
System testing: Confirms the functionality of the overall system.
Acceptance testing verifies that software satisfies user and business needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

The Meaning and Importance of Prompt Engineering
Creating efficient prompts to direct AI models in producing precise and pertinent answers is known as prompt engineering. Because it guarantees better outcomes, eliminates uncertainty, and improves user experience, it is essential for AI engagement.

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

"Tell me about cars" is a vague prompt.
Better Prompt: "Explain electric vehicles, including their advantages, disadvantages, and effects on the environment.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Determines electric machines rather than simply "cars."
Instead of leaving the response open-ended, it requests a brief overview.
To guarantee depth, ask for advantages, cons, and impact.
